Description:
    Stubs out a scaffolded controller, its seven RESTful actions and related
    views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The
    controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name
    namespaces within Admin namespaced.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers/admin and invokes helper,
    template engine and test framework generators.
    It uses non-namespaced model in app/models

Example:
	generate:
	    `rails g model car name:string address:text birth:date user:references`
	    `rails g orb:scaffold_controller car name:string address:text birth:date user:references`
    destroy:
	    `rails d model car`
	    `rails d orb:scaffold_controller car`

Example with namespace admin:
	generate:
	    `rails g model car name:string address:text birth:date user:references`
	    `rails g orb:scaffold_controller car name:string address:text birth:date user:references --namespace=admin`
    destroy:
	    `rails d model car`
	    `rails d orb:scaffold_controller car --namespace=admin`

STI
    `rails g model model_name --parent parent_model_name --migration=false`
